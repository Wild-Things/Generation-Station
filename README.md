## Generation Station - Passwords to Protect

## Overview
The website is to demonstrate a couple of things:
  * Javascript understanding.
  * Function construction



## Specifics

  * Functions are created in order to generate a random alphanumerical character
  * Users determine whether to include certain character classes
  * Users determine the length
  * The generate button will populate the box with a random string of characters as the password
